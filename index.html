            Hello! My name is Ramish Lal Khokhar. I am currently studying web development and
            learning how to design and build modern, responsive websites using HTML and CSS.
            I enjoy exploring new technologies and improving my problem-solving skills through
            hands-on practice and real-world examples. This course is helping me understand
            proper page structure, clean layout design, and the importance of writing organized
            and readable code. My goal is to continue growing as a developer and use these skills
            to create meaningful and useful web experiences in the future.
        </p>

        <h2>Pakistan</h2>
        <p>
            Pakistan is my home country and a place rich in history, culture, and natural beauty.
            It is known for its diverse landscapes, including majestic mountains, fertile plains,
            deserts, and a beautiful coastline. The country has a deep cultural heritage, warm
            hospitality, and strong family values. Pakistan’s traditions, languages, and cuisines
            reflect a blend of many civilizations that have existed here over centuries. It is a
            country full of resilience, talent, and potential, and I am proud to call it my home.
